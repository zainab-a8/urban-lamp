# Red Moon [![Translation status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/red-moon/-/svg-badge.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/red-moon/?utm_source=widget)

Red Moon is a screen filter app for night time phone use. When the
lowest brightness setting of your phone won't do the trick, Red Moon
makes your screen even darker. With Red Moon, using your phone in the
dark won't hurt your eyes and thanks to its red filter feature, you
will have a healthier sleep.

## Building

To build the app on GNU+Linux, clone the repository and run

``` ./gradlew build ```

in the root directory.

Use

``` ./gradlew installDebug ```

to install the app on a connected device.

## How it works

Red Moon dims and colors the screen by displaying a constant transparent overlay
If, for example, you have the intensity set to 0%, then the overlay will be
black with a transparency equal to the dim level you selected. If you choose a
higher intensity, the overlay will be saturated with the selected color.
